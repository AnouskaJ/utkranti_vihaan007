# 🚀 Utkranti - Empowering Rural Entrepreneurs 🌱

## Project Overview
Utkranti is an entrepreneur support platform aimed at empowering small-scale entrepreneurs and businessmen in tier 2 and tier 3 cities by facilitating access to funding and market visibility. The platform connects entrepreneurs with individuals interested in providing loans based on their product ideas.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Pitching Products**: Entrepreneurs can pitch their products on the platform, detailing their business plans and funding requirements in their preferred language. They can also upload pictures and share their bank statements for reference.
- **Loan Provision**: Individuals interested in supporting entrepreneurial ventures can browse through pitched products as if they were shopping online. They can view summaries of pitches generated using the Mistral LLM model, along with pictures and detailed descriptions. Loan givers can offer loans at an interest rate of their choice based on the pitch.
- **Language Support**: The platform supports all 22 Indian languages, allowing entrepreneurs to pitch in their native language. A speech-to-text feature further enhances accessibility.
- **Financial Analysis**: Deep learning models analyze the bank statements provided by entrepreneurs to determine their previous years' income, current year's income, and next year's expected income. This information is used to assist loan givers in making informed decisions.
- **Sustainability Promotion**: Utkranti promotes sustainability by providing an analysis of the carbon footprint generated by each product per kilogram. This information helps loan givers understand the environmental impact of the product.
- **Chat Interface**: A chatbot is available for general inquiries related to industries, companies, or any other relevant topic. This feature enhances user engagement and provides additional support to both pitchers and loan givers.
